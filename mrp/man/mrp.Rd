\title{Multilevel regression and poststratification}

\description{

  Set up survey and population data, and a multilevel regression model

  used for poststratifying by an arbitrary number of strata or \dQuote{ways}.

}



\usage{

mrp (formula,

     data, poll.weights=1,

     population=NULL, use=NULL,

     population.formula=formula,

     add=NULL, mr.formula=NULL,

     \dots)

}

\arguments{

    \item{formula}{A formula representation of the binary outcome variable

      and the desired eventual

      poststratification; i.e., the \dQuote{ways} by which to

      break down the poll and population data, which should always be

      given as factor

      variables with matching names and levels in both \code{poll}

      and \code{population}. By default, this formula will also be

      used to construct the multilevel model, with an intercept

      estimated for each named stratum. See \code{mr.formula}

      below to easily fit more complex models.}

    \item{data}{A \code{data.frame} representing a survey, containing (at

      least) the named variables in \code{formula}. The LHS response

      is expected to be dichotomous, and will be coerced to

      binary-logical (if factor, 1 for \sQuote{yes}, 0 for

      \sQuote{no}).}

    \item{poll.weights}{Name of variable of the survey weights for 

	  respondents in the poll. This is used to compute the effective 

	  \eqn{N}, weighted \eqn{\bar{Y}}, and Design Effect. Default is 

	  to make all weights equal.}

    \item{population}{A \code{data.frame} containing population (e.g. census)

      data with variable names and factor levels matching those in

      \code{poll} and specified in \code{formula}.}

    \item{use}{The column of the \code{population} data to use for

      poststratification.}

    \item{population.formula}{Any modifications to be made to the

      formula above. In the example below, we poststratify by poll,

      which has to be removed from the ways that we stratify the

      population. If used, should be of the form

      \code{.~.-var}. 

	  % DL: Should remove? MM: yes

	  % It is possible, but strongly discouraged, to use a matching

      % factor with a different name (e.g., \sQuote{edu} in \code{poll}

      % with \code{population.formula=.~education})

    }

    \item{pop.margin}{A margin of the population data to compute other

    cells relative to. An example is state-level partyID, \code{margin="state"}}

    \item{add}{A \code{list} of additional variables to add to

      the prepared \code{data.frame} used in the multilevel

      regression step. The list may contain items of two types of

      objects: a \bold{data.frame} to be left-joined onto the data via

      \code{merge}; or an \bold{expression} to be evaluated \sQuote{within} 

	  the prepared data, such as a transformation of another variable. 

	  An example of the latter would be a data.frame with

      a column containing the \sQuote{region} for every \sQuote{state}

      in the data.}

    \item{mr.formula}{A formula specification for the multilevel model

      to run in the prepared data. The left-hand side should always be

    \sQuote{response}. For convenience, the formula is handled by

      \code{update.formula} so that \code{.} indicates the 

    current formula contents on either side of the \code{~}, e.g.,

    \code{.~.+newVar}. The initial default formula is constructed as

      just an intercept term for each of the variables in the main

      formula specification (\code{(1|way1)+(1|way2)} etc.)}

    \item{\dots}{Additional arguments to be passed to the multilevel

      regression \code{\link[blme]{bglmer}} step.}

  }

\seealso{\code{\link{mrp-class}} for other

    methods on the objects produced by \code{mrp()};

      \code{\link{plotmrp}} for how to plot poststratified results  onto maps.}

##  an expanded version.

getFormula(mrp.statelevel)



## Update the mr.formula on already-prepared mrp object and re-fit:

                     z.age+p.relig.full+p.kerry.full)
