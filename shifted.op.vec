###  goal:  take state opinion levels and figure out what they would look like if projected to a different national mean
##### function that takes an opinion vector across states, a weighting vector of state population percentage of national total, and a projected national mean and gives you a new opinion vector across states with a shift on the logit scale that leads to that national mean

shifted.op.vec <- function(old.op.vec, weight.vec, nat.target){
  new_shifted_national <- function(x){   ((invlogit(logit(old.op.vec)  + x )  %*%  weight.vec   ) - nat.target)^2
  }
  needed.shift <-  optimize(f = new_shifted_national, c(-100,100))$minimum
  new.op.vec  <- invlogit(logit(old.op.vec)  + needed.shift )
  new.natop <- new.op.vec %*% weight.vec
  new.op.vec
}

#example of usage
options(digits =2)
old.op.vec <- .07* c(1:10)
weight.vec <-  runif(10)
weight.vec <-  weight.vec/ sum(weight.vec)
old.natop <- old.op.vec %*%  weight.vec

old.op.vec
old.op.vec %*% weight.vec

shifted.op.vec(old.op.vec,weight.vec, .5)
shifted.op.vec(old.op.vec,weight.vec, .5) %*% weight.vec

shifted.op.vec(old.op.vec,weight.vec, .75)
shifted.op.vec(old.op.vec,weight.vec, .75) %*% weight.vec
